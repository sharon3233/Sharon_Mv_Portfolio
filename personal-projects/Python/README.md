# BBQ FeedBack App


# Competencies 
J.F 1.6: Shows curiosity and tenaity to the business context in which the solution will be used to improve methods and maximise performance. 
J.F 3.3: Understands how to develop effective user interfaces.

I beleive my Barbeque feedback app aligns with these competencies due to the fact the users are able to interact with the app by adding photots of their choice and give their honest feedback. This feedback app can help restaurant owners improve their products and services which will overall create a better customer experience. 

# Introduction
 Using Python and Flask I created a Web application where users can upload images, give ratiings and feedback on their favorite food from the top 5 Barbeque Restaurants in Texas.  The homepage of this website loads a dashboard of all the uploaded photos. On sucessful upload, a new photo appears at the 1st tile, shifting all the other photos by 1 position.  The Displays is set to only accept certain image formats - jpg, jpeg, and png. Users are able to upload images that can be viewed through the front-end. User can by choice can submit a form with thier feeback, the submission forms are then sent to the business owners via eamil to review.
