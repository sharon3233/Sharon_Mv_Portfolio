# Chore Reminder App

# Intoduction 
We wanted to give users the opportunity to keep track of their chores on day to day basis, so we created a very reliable chore reminder app in React.At a high level users are able to add/delete chores and set notifications. Users are also given the option to download their chore list. 

* Decription 
To ensure accessiblity for all of our users we implemented Goodle Chrome Screen Reader. The home page of this chore reminder app compiles a list of chores due as they are added by the user. The "Add Chore" button (with sound effects) prompts the user to input the name of their chore, the date they wish to complete their chore, the time they want to be reminded to start their chore and an image of their chore. Notifications are sent to the user for each chore reminder that they set.  Users are also able to remove a completed chore by clicking the 'x' next to the completed chore. This app also allows has the added benefit of allowing a user to download their chore list on any device.

# Compentencies
This chore reminder app was built by several of us. We all contributed effectively by creating user stories based off our personal experiences when it comes to completing chores. Collectivley as a team we were able to combine usecases to create fuctionality for each component. We created this simple software design because we wanted to give a possible solution to a common problem. This app communicates effectively to all audiences and passed with a 100% accessibility rate.(Please refer to Demo folder to view our teams presentation-slide)
